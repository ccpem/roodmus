# Particle Scripts

Containing script for:
*  Parsing parakeet output logfiles and plotting the truth particle locations
*  Also optionally parsing extract job starfiles to read in picked particle locations and plotting on the ugraphs
*  comparative plots between, truth and picked particles including overlays and identification of unpicked particles 
*  plots to demonstrate where picked particles go missing
*  plot which helps justify particle density in micrograph
