# Trajectory Scripts

Containing scripts for:
* sampling conformations to pdb either evenly-in-time or waymarking from MD trajectory (dcd) files (waymarking.py)
* sampling conformations from a list with user-set granularity (investigate_dynamics.py)
* make ensemble pdbs from sampled conformations (ens_tools.py)
* determine b factors from trajectory and read in b-factors from (in this case refmac-refined) pdb and make comparaative plots (calc_RMSF.py)
